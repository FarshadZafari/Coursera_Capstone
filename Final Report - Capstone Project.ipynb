The city at the heart of Canada's Energy sector has been a sought after destination for new families and immigrants looking for new opportunities and affordable cost of living without sacrificing the standard of living.\n\nThis project aims to analyze the different neighborhoods in Calgary and supply a report that will determine the median house price, the median elementary public school rating, and the frequency of the nearby amenities available within a 5 km radius.\n\n## 2. Data Section:\n\nData Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_T\n\nWe will be using the link above to scrape the different neighborhoods with the postal codes start with the letter 'T'. The data will then be cleaned to only include neighborhoods pertaining to Calgary.\n\n#### Foursquare API Data:\n\nWe will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 5 kilometers.\n\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood\n2. Neighborhood Latitude\n3. Neighborhood Longitude\n4. Venue\n5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n6. Venue Latitude\n7. Venue Longitude\n8. Venue Category\n"

Conclusion Section\n\nIn this project, using k-means cluster algorithm I separated the neighborhood into 3 different clusters and for 35 different lattitude and logitude from dataset, which have very-similar neighborhoods around them. Using the charts above results presented to a particular neighborhood based on average house prices and school rating have been made.\n\nI feel rewarded with the efforts and believe this course with all the topics covered is well worthy of appreciation. This project has shown me a practical application to resolve a real situation that has impacting personal and financial impact using Data Science tools. The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision better with confidence."
